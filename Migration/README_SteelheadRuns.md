###Readme - Steelhead Runs

The file “Steelhead Runs.kml” defines a Google Earth overlay.  That is, a collection of balloon-shaped icons that float at fixed geographical locations over the landscape image shown by Google Earth.  The icons locate rivers in California and Oregon that support steelhead runs.  As you adjust your viewpoint with the mouse or the GE control symbols, the icons move along with the earth image.  The color, size, and decoration of an icon gives information about the run timing and magnitude.  Clicking on an icon opens a description pane with more specific information and useful links, including river flow and weather forecast.  Double clicking on an icon flies you to a close-up of the icon location and also  opens the description pane.  Click anywhere off the pane to make it disappear.

To  see the overlay, launch Google Earth, go to the “File” menu, and select “Open”.  (If your computer doesn’t already have the GE application, you can download it for free here.)  Navigate to your downloaded copy of “Steelhead Runs.kml” and click the “Open” button.  An item labeled “Steelhead Runs.kml”  will appear under “Temporary Places” in the “Places” section of the lefthand sidebar, and the whole set of steelhead icons should appear on the earth image pane that  fills most of the screen.  If you don’t see the icons, click on the checkbox just to the left of the “Steelhead Runs.kml” item in the sidebar.  A checkmark will appear in the box, and, at the same time, the icons will appear on the image pane.

Alternatively, if your machine has a copy of Google Earth, even if it is not running, if you double click on your copy of the Steelhead Runs.kml file, Google Earth should launch and it should open the file for you.

Finally, if you want your copy of Steelhead Runs.kml to open automatically each time you launch GE, simply drag the “Steelhead Runs.kml” label out of the “Temporary Places”  folder and into the “My Places” folder located higher up in the “Places” section of the sidebar.  Another way to accomplish the same thing, is to simply quit GE.  You will be asked if you want to save your temporary places, and you should say yes.  GE will then move “Steelhead Runs.kml” into “My Places” for you.
